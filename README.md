# Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm is the algorithm used to find the shortest path that connects all the nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by sorting all the edges of the graph in ascending order of their weight and then gradually adding the edges to the tree, ensuring that no cycle is created in the process.

Use the `README.md` to get started.
